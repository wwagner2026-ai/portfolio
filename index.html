<h2>About me</h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Wyatt Wagner</strong> and I, much like the others on this planet, am human. This means I have various skills and interests that all add to this funny little thing called personality (or character). And due to this personality, I have even more various wants and needs, one of those being a job. with a job i can fufill most of my wants and needs, like food, water, entertainment, and maybe even a box so I dont sleep on the street! I may not be the best at what I do, but I may be good enough for what im told to do. And even if im not the best, I'll get better as I work. I have a few interests, as I am very much human and am in no way shape or form an alien. But these interests include: Bugs(but not if they are too close), learning hands on, thinking and using my creativity, world history, making games, playing games, and writing. These interests are pretty normal and basic but they make me who I am.</p>
