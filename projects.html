<h1>Rock Paper Scissors</h1>
<img src="images/RPS Screenshot.jpg" alt="Photo of a Rock Paper Scissors game I made in python with a group" width="300">
<p>Me and a small group of kids at my school had made this game for a grade. This is worth bringing up because it was my first coding project I did as a junior.</p>

<h1>This Portfolio</h1>

<p>This Portfolio is a project I have been working on for days now. It is worth noting due to it being the reason you are learning about me.</p>
